# Tubeless

Tubeless is a simple tool to aggregate YouTube videos by multiple channels without a Google account.

Watched videos are distinguishable by the color of visited links.

## Dependencies

Everything you need to get started is included in the repository except for jQuery, which is loaded from the official CDN.


## Alternatives

It's possible to add a channel's feed to your news reader and get new videos that way. See https://www.youtube.com/t/rss_feeds for more information.
